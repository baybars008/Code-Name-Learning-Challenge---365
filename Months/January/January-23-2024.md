<h3> Dynamic Malware Analysis </h3> 

#### 1. The Importance of Dynamic Malware Analysis for SOC Analysts
```
"If you ask a friend who works as a SOC analyst what they do in their job, one of the things you'll likely hear is 'I analyze suspicious files.
' Malware analysis is one of the most crucial tasks in a SOC. 
No matter what level of SOC analyst you are, I can confidently say that you will be closely working with malware in your daily life.
```
```
But why dynamic analysis and not static analysis?
```
Each analysis method has its unique advantages and disadvantages. In fact, these two methods are not substitutes for each other. When you want to analyze malware, you need to combine these two methods and conduct your analysis. Malware analysis is divided into two methods as an analysis approach, and in this training, we will focus on Dynamic Analysis.
```
```
As a SOC analyst, you are racing against time. The faster you can detect a malicious situation, the quicker you can respond to it. SOC analysts prefer the dynamic analysis method first, as it produces much faster results compared to static analysis.
```
```
The dynamic analysis method, which can be summarized as 'run the malware and examine its activities,' may seem simple, but it is a very challenging and dangerous method of analysis for someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing."
